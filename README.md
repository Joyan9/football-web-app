This app is aimed at increasing the popularity of football in India and also at the same enhancement my data analyst skills. I realised that visualisations made using programming languages are quite simple but not many non-technical staff are aware of it. Hence apps like these can simplfy their job. The aim is to add more visualisations in the coming future. 


I scraped data using selenium library from fotmob website,

Using this data, I gathered a lot key insights on how the teams performed and how some teams underperformed. Furthermore, using the expected goals values scraped from each match I created an expected points table. This points table gives credit to the qualoty of chances created unlike the traditional points table which only accounts for goals scored.
